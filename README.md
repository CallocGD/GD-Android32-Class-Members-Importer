# Sync-GD-Android-class-members
A Script to move cocos2d &amp; Geometry Class members and their accurate offsets and vtables to Ghidra &amp; IDA

My Goal with this library is simple

- Provide readability and accurate class information 
- Fill all subclass members into a class object where they go as best and as accurate possible. 
- building new structures via merging them as well as transporting these objects between other projects with ease.
